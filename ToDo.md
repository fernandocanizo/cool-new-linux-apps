# ToDo

- 2022.04.26
  - review [Julia
    Evans's](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/)
    post, which seems to have the same intention than this repo.

  - review [ibraheemdev's](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) "Modern
    Unix" list of apps.

    I've already checked this one before deciding to start this repo, I think
    there's nothing there that I haven't added here that is worthy, but still
    the remaining apps can make it to the "Unworthy" list.

  - Add a section at the end of the file linking similar work, like Julia's and
    ibraheemdev's
